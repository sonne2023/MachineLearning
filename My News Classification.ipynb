distribution world organization mantis consultants cambridge uk supersedes mantis co uk lines archive name atheism logic alt atheism archive name logic last modified april version constructing logical argument although much argument usenet general quality argument found poor article attempts provide gentle introduction logic hope improving general level debate logic science reasoning proof thinking inference concise oed logic allows us analyze piece reasoning determine whether correct valid invalid course one need study logic order reason correctly nevertheless little basic knowledge logic often helpful constructing analyzing argument note claim made whether logic universally applicable matter much open debate document merely explains use logic given already decided logic right tool job propositions statements building blocks logical argument proposition statement either true false example raining today tuesday propositions may either asserted said true denied said false note technical meaning deny everyday meaning proposition meaning statement particular arrangement words used express god exists exists god express proposition argument quote monty python sketch connected series statements establish definite proposition argument consists three stages first propositions necessary argument continue stated called premises argument evidence reasons accepting argument conclusions premises assertions often indicated phrases since obviously phrase obviously often viewed suspicion used intimidate others accepting suspicious premises something seem obvious afraid question always say oh yes right obvious heard explanation next premises used derive propositions process known inference inference one proposition arrived basis one propositions already accepted various forms valid inference propositions arrived inference may used inference inference often denoted phrases implies therefore finally arrive conclusion argument proposition affirmed basis premises inference conclusions often indicated phrases therefore follows conclude conclusion often stated final stage inference example every event cause premise universe beginning premise beginnings involve event premise implies beginning universe involved event inference therefore universe cause inference conclusion note conclusion one argument might premise another argument proposition called premise conclusion respect particular argument terms make sense isolation sometimes argument follow order given example conclusions might stated first premises stated afterwards support conclusion perfectly valid sometimes little confusing recognizing argument much harder recognizing premises conclusions many people shower writing assertions without ever producing anything one might reasonably describe argument statements look like arguments example bible accurate jesus must either insane evil liar son god argument conditional statement assert premises necessary support appears conclusion also suffers number logical flaws come later another example god created therefore duty god phrase duty god proposition since neither true false therefore conclusion sentence argument finally causality important consider statement form b interested establishing b offered evidence statement argument trying establish truth b argument explanation example must something wrong engine car start argument car start something wrong engine explanation two traditional types argument deductive inductive deductive argument one provides conclusive proof conclusions argument premises true conclusion must also true deductive argument either valid invalid valid argument defined one premises true conclusion true inductive argument one premises provide evidence truth conclusion inductive arguments valid invalid however talk whether better worse arguments probable premises forms argument ordinary language neither deductive inductive however concentrate moment deductive arguments often viewed rigorous convincing important note fact deductive argument valid imply conclusion holds slightly counter intuitive nature implication must consider carefully obviously valid argument consist true propositions however argument may entirely valid even contains false propositions example insects wings premise woodlice insects premise therefore woodlice wings conclusion conclusion true argument premises false argument premises true however conclusion would true argument thus entirely valid subtly reach true conclusion one false premises fish live sea premise dolphins fish premise therefore dolphins live sea conclusion however one thing reach false conclusion valid inference true premises therefore draw truth table implication symbol denotes implication premise b conclusion f represent true false respectively premise conclusion inference b b f f premises false inference f valid conclusion true false f f premises true conclusion false inference must invalid premises true inference valid conclusion must true sound argument valid argument whose premises true sound argument therefore arrives true conclusion careful confuse valid arguments sound arguments delve structure logical arguments would require lengthy discussion linguistics philosophy simpler probably useful summarize major pitfalls avoided constructing argument pitfalls known fallacies everyday english term fallacy used refer mistaken beliefs well faulty reasoning leads beliefs fair enough logic term generally used refer form technically incorrect argument especially argument appears valid convincing purposes discussion define fallacy logical argument appears correct seen incorrect examined closely studying fallacies aim avoid misled following list fallacies intended exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal force appeal force committed arguer resorts force threat force order try push acceptance conclusion often used politicians summarized might makes right force threatened need direct threat arguer example thus ample proof truth bible refuse accept truth burn hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem literally argument directed man abusive variety argumentum ad hominem occurs instead trying disprove truth assertion arguer attacks person people making assertion invalid truth assertion depend upon goodness asserting example atheism evil philosophy practised communists murderers sometimes court law doubt cast upon testimony witness showing example known perjurer valid way reducing credibility testimony given witness argumentum ad hominem however demonstrate witness testimony false conclude otherwise fall victim argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere list circumstantial form argumentum ad hominem committed person argues opponent ought accept truth assertion opponent particular circumstances example perfectly acceptable kill animals food argue otherwise quite happy wear leather shoes abusive charge inconsistency used excuse dismissing opponent argument fallacy also used means rejecting conclusion example course would argue positive discrimination bad thing white particular form argumentum ad hominem one alleges one adversary rationalizing conclusion formed selfish interests also known poisoning well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium means argument ignorance fallacy occurs whenever argued something must true simply proved false equivalently argued something must false proved true note assuming something false proved true basic scientific principle examples course bible true nobody prove otherwise course telepathy psychic phenomena exist nobody shown proof real note fallacy apply court law one generally assumed innocent proven guilty also scientific investigation known event would produce certain evidence occurred absence evidence validly used infer event occur example flood described bible would require enormous volume water present earth earth tenth much water even count frozen ice poles therefore flood occurred science validly assume lack evidence something occurred conclude certainty occurred however argumentum ad misericordiam appeal pity also known special pleading fallacy committed arguer appeals pity sake getting conclusion accepted example murder mother father axe please find guilty suffering enough orphan argumentum ad populum known appealing gallery appealing people commit fallacy attempt win acceptance assertion appealing large group people form fallacy often characterized emotive language example pornography must banned violence women bible must true millions people know trying tell mistaken fools argumentum ad numeram fallacy closely related argumentum ad populum consists asserting people support believe proposition likely proposition correct argumentum ad verecundiam appeal authority uses admiration famous try win support assertion example isaac newton genius believed god line argument always completely bogus example reference admitted authority particular field may relevant discussion subject example distinguish quite clearly stephen hawking concluded black holes give radiation john searle concluded impossible build intelligent computer hawking physicist reasonably expect opinions black hole radiation informed searle linguist questionable whether well qualified speak subject machine intelligence fallacy accident fallacy accident committed general rule applied particular case whose accidental circumstances mean rule inapplicable error made one goes general specific example christians generally dislike atheists christian must dislike atheists fallacy often committed moralists legalists try decide every moral legal question mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization fallacy reverse fallacy accident occurs one forms general rule examining specific cases representative possible cases example jim bakker insincere christian therefore christians insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter sweeping generalization occurs general rule applied particular situation features particular situation render rule inapplicable sweeping generalization opposite hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc known false cause fallacies fallacy non causa pro causa occurs one identifies something cause event actually shown cause example took aspirin prayed god headache disappeared god cured headache fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs something assumed cause event merely happened event example soviet union collapsed taking atheism therefore must avoid atheism reasons cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy similar post hoc ergo propter hoc asserts two events occur together must causally related leaves room factors may cause events petitio principii fallacy occurs premises least questionable conclusion reached circulus demonstrando fallacy occurs one assumes premise conclusion one wishes reach often proposition rephrased fallacy appears valid argument example homosexuals must allowed hold government office hence government official revealed homosexual lose job therefore homosexuals anything hide secret open blackmail therefore homosexuals allowed hold government office note argument entirely circular premise conclusion argument like actually cited reason british secret services official ban homosexual employees another example classic know god exists bible tells us know bible true word god complex question fallacy interrogation fallacy presupposition one example classic loaded question stopped beating wife question presupposes definite answer another question even asked trick often used lawyers cross examination ask questions like hide money stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions long ec interference affairs allowed continue chancellor plan two years ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi fallacy irrelevant conclusion consists claiming argument supports particular conclusion actually logically nothing conclusion example christian may begin saying argue teachings christianity undoubtably true argues length christianity great help many people matter well argues shown christian teachings true sadly fallacious arguments often successful arouse emotions cause others view supposed conclusion favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs key word used two different meanings argument example could affordable free software make sure remains free users like must place license make sure always freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs premises used argument ambiguous careless ungrammatical phrasing accent accent another form fallacy shifting meaning case meaning changed altering parts statement emphasized example consider speak ill friends speak ill friends fallacies composition one fallacy composition conclude property shared parts something must apply whole example bicycle made entirely low mass components therefore lightweight fallacy composition conclude property number individual items shared collection items example car uses less petrol causes less pollution bus therefore cars less environmentally damaging buses fallacy division fallacy division opposite fallacy composition like opposite exists two varieties first assume property thing must apply parts example studying rich college therefore must rich assume property collection items shared item example ants destroy tree therefore ant destroy tree slippery slope argument argument states one event occur harmful events proof made harmful events caused first event example legalize marijuana would legalize crack heroin nation full drug addicts welfare therefore legalize marijuana based b fallacies type fallacies fallacies occur one attempts argue things way similar without actually specifying way similar examples history based upon faith bible also form history islam based faith christianity based faith islam form christianity cats form animal based carbon chemistry dogs form animal based carbon chemistry dogs form cat affirmation consequent fallacy argument form implies b b true therefore true understand fallacy examine truth table implication given earlier denial antecedent fallacy argument form implies b false therefore b false truth table implication makes clear fallacy note fallacy different non causa pro causa latter form implies b false therefore b false fact imply b problem implication invalid rather falseness allow us deduce anything b converting conditional fallacy argument form b therefore b argumentum ad antiquitam fallacy asserting something right good simply old way always argumentum ad novitam opposite argumentum ad antiquitam fallacy asserting something correct simply new newer something else argumentum ad crumenam fallacy believing money criterion correctness money likely right argumentum ad lazarum fallacy assuming someone poor sounder virtuous one wealthier fallacy opposite argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam incorrect belief assertion likely true often heard argumentum ad nauseum one employs constant repetition asserting something bifurcation also referred black white fallacy bifurcation occurs one presents situation two alternatives fact alternatives exist exist plurium interrogationum many questions fallacy occurs questioner demands simple answer complex question non sequitur non sequitur argument conclusion drawn premises logically connected red herring fallacy committed irrelevant material introduced issue discussed everyone attention diverted away points made towards different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs abstract concept treated concrete thing shifting burden proof burden proof always person making assertion proposition shifting burden proof special case argumentum ad ignorantium fallacy putting burden proof person denies questions assertion made source fallacy assumption something true unless proven otherwise straw man straw man fallacy misrepresent someone else position attacked easily knock misrepresented position conclude original position demolished fallacy fails deal actual arguments made extended analogy fallacy extended analogy often occurs suggested general rule argued fallacy assume mentioning two different situations argument general rule constitutes claim situations analogous fallacy best explained using real example debate anti cryptography legislation believe always wrong oppose law breaking position odious implies would supported martin luther king saying cryptography legislation important struggle black liberation dare tu quoque famous fallacy occurs action argued acceptable party performed instance randomly abusive abusive',\n",

absolutely way even able death involve three days three nights even using modern time measurements led suspect error another one matthew little mistakes gospel writer put false words god mouth matter made prediction unconvincing counter convincing hearing understanding jesus tool habit speaking vast audiences parables stories deeper meaning could found already one elect chosen understand message

zechariah reads little differently lo king comes triumphant victorious humble riding ass ass colt command peace nations much difference except zechariah involves one animal ass colt matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently thus jesus call colt adult ass matthew version get comical picture divine christ sweating straddle two donkeys could inevitably lead theological proctological dilemma find account written earlier st mark colt called brought jesus indeed fits verses zechariah properly shows us matthew attempt use prophetic verses bungled excluding many respectable christians met noticed christ thought ridden asses situation often reversed nowadays entering jerusalem temple priests angered people youngsters calling jesus messiah jesus replied might expect matthew done mt read mouth babes sucklings thou brought perfect praise likely matthew made response since jesus never one point little prophetic things since might expect quote error seems fit matthew track record quite well might ask jesus matthew read source reads psalms yahweh lord majestic name whole world whose glory chanted heavens babes infants founded bulwark foes still enemy avenger passages hardly need comment perfect praise spoken psalm praise given g messiah king jesus mentioned seems one case matthew pen making convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said lord jesus said asked promised jewish messiah king descended jews agree king david jesus counters quoting psalms lord said lord sit right hand put enemies feet taken face value jesus denying necessity davidic descent one assumes opposition answer course christian answer agrees trying make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature messiah king tempting believe one christian interested matters investigation problems jesus time psalm thought messiah easy see david might refer messiah superior need look scriptures messiah see expected great king bringing jews times even better david rule course jews listening good answer passage could indeed refer divine messiah christians worship problem lies meaning psalm error apparently several jews jesus time also made one must remember various factions among jews often result different expectations messiah king jesus apparently one adventists like audience thought messiah advent imminent interpreted psalms among others messianic problem psalm literally reads yhvh utterance lord sit right hand make enemies footstool yhvh sends forth mighty scepter zion rule midst foes people offer freely day lead host holy mountains priest order melchizedek forever word lord often mistakenly capitalised christian bibles denote divinity lord hebrew word adoni capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord generic term would use used often scriptures refer kings g merely address respect nothing text imply word refers either divinity messiah king supposed written david certain title psalm translates either psalm david psalm david seems fitting assume written court poet david covenant endorsement g psalm written david unlikely would talking messiah idea perfect king descended david present david age extensive tales david doings sayings none include praises messiah many psalms show evidence written long david dead times exile g put show favour david kingdom hold description psalm fit david well david promised g rise power victory enemies successful judgement among nations conquered achieved priesthood common melchizedek righteous king enabled bless people fits blame problem matthew alone though artificial prophecy alluded though use scripture rather questionable still event common gospels let matthew little easily time interesting note though matthew dresses event earlier gospel mark tells tale jesus simply speaking crowd matthew pharisees became religious competition infant christianity target jesus question might expect matthew writes event ends embarrassing pharisees power pen moses jesus together along leave gospel story matthew momentarily see pseudo prophecy john gospel gospel story john deserves special treatment seems far removed real events jesus career told even matthew moment look one verse early church leaders founded religion jewish hopes messiah king artificial extension original promises made g constructing history abraham moses wrote promise land nationhood jewish people accomplished eventually rule king david christians came along later decided would claim fulfillment promise expanded promise preaching heavenly kingdom john j c speaking father abraham rejoiced see day say glad would nice tie approval jesus abraham abraham knew nothing jesus messiah anything christian tried failed find event old testament corresponds john little prophecy par course see st john making old testament backings like forerunner matthew many christians know faith many foundations fraud surprising still cling potter field told jesus betrayed jerusalem one followers judas iscariot matthew writes mt throwing pieces silver temple judas departed chief priests taking silver said lawful us put treasury since blood money bought potter field bury strangers fulfilled spoken prophet jeremiah took thirty pieces silver price price set sons israel gave potter field lord directed prophecy utterly gross bastardisation old testament scripture first matthew made mistake regarding name prophet zechariah utters verses matthew makes use zech weighed wages thirty shekels silver yhvh said cast treasury lordly price paid took thirty shekels silver cast treasury house yhvh first verses zechariah deal betrayer messiah g deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function presiding people shortly g would send judah israel conflict one another word treasury replaced king james scholars potter precisely made matthew quote fit better blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also makes perfect sense zechariah context whereas potter field totally unrelated whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation however given matthew track record one finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty course matthew would ample reason altering text thirty pieces silver match judas situation christians seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy toss around however correct translation zechariah directly contradicts situation judas high priests high priests would put money treasury worthless shepherd zechariah exactly opposite course average thursday night bible student prophecy presented matthew would taken new testament face value matthew work convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots jesus led away crucified mt gave vinegar drink mingled gall tasted would drink crucified divided garments among casting lots might fulfilled spoken prophet parted garments among upon vesture cast lots first vinegar offered jesus actually common sour wine type roman soldiers drank regularly find right jesus dies soldiers give drink polluted gall jn jesus said thirst bowl vinegar stood put sponge full vinegar hyssop held mouth received vinegar said finished matthew seems drawing passage prophets one psalms ps looked pity none comforters found none gave poison food lit put gall meat thirst gave vinegar drink add punishment upon punishment may acquittal thee let blotted book living course sour wine offered jesus done request drink indeed seem show pity psalm quoted david political military enemies messiah jesus surprising run problem see jesus psalm asks g damnation crucifiers whereas jesus gospels says lk jesus said father forgive know matthew misses attempt create prophecy gall bitter substance put jesus drink meat psalm stipulates prophecy vinegar faulty naturally ask casting lots brings nd psalm deserves discussion suffice say fact jesus clothes divided told great thing turns happened often felon days soon see perhaps least erroneous passage psalm applied jesus indeed bring interesting question quality jesus clothes man removed worldly possessions ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises suspicions nd psalm psalm attributed david lament condition attack enemies becomes song praise yhvh hope taken context parts seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quite well examine primary passages verse god god forsaken far helping far words groaning oh god cry day answer night find rest jesus said cried first sentence cross suggests whole psalm really jesus rather king david course rest first stanza fit nicely jesus execution jesus pictured complaining whole ordeal supposed like lamb led mute shearers indeed jesus much groaning even cross certainly cry day night cross worm man scorned men see mock make faces wag heads committed cause yhvh let deliver delights seems fit jesus execution pretty well exception holy messiah called worm many bulls encompass open mouths widely like ravening roaring lion yea dogs round company evildoers encir cle pierced hands feet see bones divide garments among cast lost raiment yhvh far away deliver soul sword life power dog save mouth lion afflicted soul horns wild bull would seem quite convincing sure early christian fathers wrote prophecy thought unfortunately prophecy fatal flaw words pierced really exist psalm correct hebrew translation yea dogs round company evildoers encircles like lion hands feet hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form mean pierced differ one phonetic character word hebrew text literally like lion ka ari makes sense context even fits animal imagery employed psalm writer convenience would urge christian change word ka aru add needed yet artificial weight prophecy christian translators chosen correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesus absence say much honesty translators apart erroneous verse psalm lend jesus easily verse speaks sufferer saved sword rather cross naturally fits psalm true subject king david side note know crucifixions pierce hands palms rather forearms say much favour traditional thought resurrected jesus showing disciples scars palms facts bound religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability time attempt draw many direct links psalm lord jesus psalm like many others minds gospel writers compiled stories interpretations jesus life death much scriptures may contributed actually got written question serious repercussions christian theology easy see faithful fundamentalists events new testament might enhanced scribes eager matthew less speculate simply investigate scriptural matters prophetic claims far said good things st matthew reference piercing looks lot like jesus crucifixion john gospel recount written years fact tells us jesus execution jn one soldiers pierced side spear came blood water things took place scripture fulfilled look pierced course built passage taken blatantly context prophet zechariah tells us much nation israel split jerusalem judah go war zc yhvh give victory judah day seek destroy nations come jerusalem judah pour spirit compassion supplication jerusalem look pierced mourn weep bitterly like weep firstborn child john attempt make prophecy perhaps weaker matthew attempts matthew least usually excontexts one passage john errors grossly obvious blatant speak well gospel writers helps show prophetic aspects religion founded reckoned transgressors arrest jesus quickly executed claiming jewish kingship messiahship according one version gospel tale jesus gets executed along two thieves mk crucified two robbers one right one left scripture fulfilled says reckoned transgressors mark trying link jesus passage isaiah servant nation israel passage messiah one reads whole chapter isaiah surrounding chapters one sees servant nation verses also servant gone past prediction come event servant thought criminal also happens fit description jesus passage really messiah still clear executing jesus two thieves would fulfill prophecy isaiah jesus would fittingly fulfill whole ministry considered blasphemer troublemaker throughout career locking onto single event rather poor way steal prophecy least case see mark could made better analogy general comparisons mark goes tell us crucified jesus also reviled expected couple robbers course later recount st luke decides change things luke tells us lk one criminals hanged railed messiah save us certainly fits mark recount tells people crucified jesus said save robbers luke goes criminal rebuked first saying fear g since sentence condemnation indeed justly receiving due reward deeds man done nothing wrong said jesus remember come kingdom jesus answered verily say today paradise little dialogue seems highly contrived stretches imagination bit see picture one ruffian rebuking fellow criminal eloquent speech rather strange picture criminal lamenting goodness punishment justness suffering man apparently noble principle seem likely robber wonder amount theatrics created luke course luke recount also disagrees mark luke one criminal revile jesus easy enough discount discrepancy account made wish believe part error free words g avenue open yet another example writer trying take old testament passage expand reinterpret suit theology case embroidery creates embarrassing problems seen end world mt comes perhaps one extraordinary embarrassing passages new testament found three synoptic gospel stories casts unfavourable doubt whole theory christianity jesus mentions destruction jewish temples buildings disciples ask end world warning disciples tell us temple destruction sign coming close age jesus take care one leads astray many come name saying christ hear wars rumours wars must take place end yet nation rise nation beginning birthpangs deliver put death false prophets arise lead many astray endures end saved gospel preached throughout whole world testimony

inerrant nature bible said phrase generation shall pass away really means race people pass away course word generation used many times refer exactly generation disciples interesting notion god decided learn greek learn well enough make clear quite obvious rest dialogue disciples least supposed live end world charge mistranslation completely blown away looking apostles responses becomes abundantly clear rev peter john rev jesus meant exactly said end near years christians rationalised th chapter matthew ignored meaning altogether years waited executed leader come back hearing wars rumours wars sure coming soon surely must must wait imagine tired must sitting around holy waiting right moment spring shortly crucifixion jesus nazareth joshua ben joseph died said three days three days three nights three periods time three eternal seconds three whatever decide makes less trouble seen resurrected glowing divine radiance saviour decided best interests new religion stick around therefore disappeared sight heaven story goes anyway seen many things attributed jesus people got around writing gospel stories jesus fulfiller prophecy scripture seen though matter quite shaky throughout church history christians held fast faith simple belief doctrinal objections could solved argumentation brute force faith forgetfulness kept away question question investigate never easiest way treat matters thus years prophecies cited new testament gone largely accepted things may well continue way time pausing moment consider way doctrines christianity accepted used properly improperly support

judas rejects scholarly opinion scholars rephrases scholars opinion subject know matthew hang acts probably records death although possible plausible fell hanging hit rocks thereby bursting open longer assume case therefore contradiction matthew say judas died result hanging scholars believe iprobably quoted show highly regard scholars explanations looking texts initially assume judas died however highly probable also nothing greek suggest success failure simply means hang oneself actually research greek word apacgw find denote success scholars indeed excellent reason assume suicide successful pointed recently checked several lexicons greek english lexicon new testament louw nida robinson greek english lexicon new testament greek english lexicon new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale greek english lexicon new testament early christian writings bauer arndt gingrich new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher couple simply stated hanged oneself couple explicit stated apacgw means specifically kill hanging couple also noted meaning one root words apacgw strangle throttle choke pretty much invalidates guy suggested david joslin judas hung upside one best references though robinson greek english lexicon new testament stated translation gave root words literal translation related greek words use roots also presented specific examples word greek literature give context word apagchw two root words gchw strangle root root word apo means literally away root words included words denote transition mean transition place eg greek word apagello means send message apo also denote change state specifically change life death robinson specifically makes comparison word apokteiuo means kill literal meaning word apacgw means throttle strangle put way implicitly denotes change life state ie away life death word apacgw mean hang specifically denotes death well thus robinson quite specific state means hang oneself end one life hanging notes use apacgw homers odessy denote context presents example apacgw used explicitly mean suicide hanging since perfectly good word strangling without added denotation death insist bible written god every word precicely correct stuck complete meaning apacgw ie since word apacgw used death denoted result way note mr decenso also presents example apacgw septuagint greek translation ot used time jesus used samuel ahithophel saw advice followed saddled donkey arose went home house city put household order hanged died buried father tomb notice stated ahithophel hanged gr sept apagcho explicitly adds died doubt result matthew explicitly told judas died note mr decenso say septuagint translation hebrew greek shown original meaning hebrew ie hebrew say died thus whether simply echoed greek also pointed regardless added died correct translation would still apacgw man indeed die strangulation redundant correct evidence septuagint repeatedly rewritten reedited included versions contradicted editing even necessarily executed greeks thus sure use septuagint stands paragon ancient greek really need prove point mr decenso example ancient greek someone committing apacgw surviving otherwise would see simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence would note mr decenso everytime go way research one apparently contrived exegisis pretty much find false thus think going add text something source clearly says better explicit greek historical source justify way mr rose statement trees around potter field still trees around ledges rocky pavement bottom unless mr rose show trees two thousand years old year old stumps thousand year old description area mentions trees inappropriate assert present placement trees prove location trees two thousand years ago things change argument ie money judas used silvers second question mr decenso ask could sure money judas purchased land indeed betrayal rather source would point acts specifically mention reward iniquity acts also specifically mentions act iniquity talking ie acts concerning judas guide arrested jesus would point bible describes act iniquity immediately discusses reward iniquity would rather inane suggest action iniquity one discussed notice verse word iniquity used rather states judas became guide arrested jesus writer stop vs numbered us obtained part ministry part judas play ministry true peter author acts specifically call judas betrayal iniquity matter neither john specifically call judas actions iniquity either john say judas took money box rather said thought judas money box jesus telling buy need feast give something poor receiving morsel immediately went night note said judas left say took money box thus see explanation still seems would choose unproven iniquity mentioned another author different book written different time iniquity explicitly mentioned author acts find forced contrived course particular argument becomes moot since seen evidence apacgw means suicide see since judas hanging successful could spent money mentioned john matthew mark explicitly say betrayal high holy day ie passover thus could spent money killing next day thus money bought field blood would pieces silver course got pieces silver night well thus spent either oh dear believe house cards comming maybe point discuss whether jesus crucified friday saturday part argument judas way prophesy potter field came ie mention matthew say please done study death remind discuss reminding discuss part verse discussing wish would quit procrastinating sidestepping issues later dave butler
